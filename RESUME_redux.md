#### Personal Programming Axioms
* The price we must pay for being god-of-the-machine is Understanding.
* The best programmer writes the most Readable code. Speed is for the compiler.
* The first version is noisy, buggy, won't map-reduce, and later versions matter.
* The best code will survive long after a programmer leaves it.
* Single Point of Truth: One complexity, One bug, One change.
* Code explicit functionality rather than side effects, and /** document it */
* Comments are good, code that describes itself is better.
* Think about optimization now, but do the actual optimization later.
* Just Prototype. And don't expect another shot at it, so make it good!
* Refactor, Sooner rather than later; clean code grows into powerful code.
* Disciplined, results oriented software development is always in style.
* How most production code should be judged (in order):
  - Functionality: intended results are produced (with constraints in mind)
  - Survivability: useable again elsewhere (maintainable/readable/modular)
  - Robustness: stability with a wide range of input (no bugs)
  - Resource Use: resources used conservatively (Big-O, memory, threads, ...)
  - Everything Else: elegance/robust-unit-tests/optimal-efficiency/...
* The Unix way feels right (http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html)

#### Other Credo
* Persistence (iteration) is disproportionately important to success. (So, iterate. Faster.)
* Rules are for people who don't know any better; Rules are important, but understanding sets you free.
* Luck is where preparation meets random opportunity, which is happening constantly.
* To make the next best thing, the current best thing must be mundane.
* A spoonful of test dissolves a pound of design.
* Without clear goals we are wasting people's time, and we are made of time.
* Do not fear complexity, simplify it.
