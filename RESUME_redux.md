### Notable Personal Software Projects

#### Suffrag Ex Machina

A machine-learning engine built in C# to test an experimental *ensemble learning* technique (elects using ranked-choice voting). Independent study, built from scratch as a learning exercise, inspired by a former student. Notably includes optimized-matrix-math and "secret sauce" training optimizations (~10x improvement over optimal-learning-rate alone).
#### Ethos

A [prototype for a web-based assessment system](http://codegiraffe.com/qeval/qual.html) designed to provoke personality development. Still evolving, based on years of personal reflection, religious study, and leadership.
#### Impetus

An experimental suite of tools and prototypes to build a-game-about-Project-Management. This project is a key manifestation from [my own personal vision of the future](https://github.com/mvaganov/self/blob/master/manifesto.md). I also call this "my dragon".

#### Hobbies

* Software Side-projects, Game Jams, and Hackathons (samples at http://codegiraffe.com)

#### Personal Programming Axioms
* The price we must pay for being wizards is Understanding. It's a price that must be paid.
* The best programmer writes the most Readable code. Speed is for the compiler.
* The best code will survive long after a programmer leaves it.
* Single Point of Truth: One complexity, One bug, One change.
* Code explicit functionality rather than side effects, and /** document it */
* Comments are good, code that describes itself is better.
* Think about optimization now, but do the actual optimization later.
* Just Prototype. And don't expect another shot at it, so make it good!
* Refactor, Sooner rather than later; clean code grows into powerful code.
* Disciplined, results oriented software development is always in style.
* How most production code should be judged (in order):
  - Functionality: intended results are produced (with constraints in mind)
  - Survivability: useable again elsewhere (maintainable/readable/modular)
  - Robustness: stability with a wide range of input (no bugs)
  - Resource Use: resources used conservatively (Big-O, memory, threads, ...)
  - Everything Else: elegance/robust-unit-tests/optimal-efficiency/...
* The Unix way feels right (http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html)

#### Other Credo
* Persistence (iteration) is disproportionately important to success. (So, iterate. Faster.)
* Rules are for people who don't know any better; Rules are important, but Understanding sets you free.
* Luck is where preparation meets random opportunity, which is happening constantly.
* To make the next best thing, the current best thing must be mundane.
* A spoonful of test dissolves a pound of design.
* Without clear goals we are wasting people's time, and we are made of time.
* Do not fear complexity, simplify it.
