  - Leading by example (good code, honest testing, and honest communication)
  - Programming examples written in real-time, during class
  - Writing and testing working code from scratch, to show problem solving
  - Understanding the C/C++ memory model (basic Von Neumann Architecture)
  - High-level programming philosophy (see end of Resume)
  - Lab work as start-to-finish programming projects. They Must Write Code.
  - Comparing academic and professional programming processes
  - Agile and agile (small-a) development, favoring the small-a
  - Joy-of-discovery and character-building-pain-of-debugging are important

## Other
#### Hobbies

#### Personal Programming Axioms
* The best programmer writes the most Readable code. Speed is for the compiler.
* The best code will survive long after a programmer leaves it.
* Single Point of Truth: One complexity, One bug, One change.
* Code explicit functionality rather than side effects, and /** document it */
* Comments are good, code that describes itself is better
* Think about optimization now, but do the actual optimization later.
* Just Prototype (and expect not to be given another shot at it).
* Program with a purpose: Understand the end-goal as soon as possible.
* Refactor sooner rather than later; clean code grows into powerful code.
* Disciplined, results oriented software development is always in style.
* How most production code should be judged (in order):
  - Functionality: intended results are produced (with constraints in mind)
  - Survivability: useable again elsewhere (maintainable/readable/modular)
  - Robustness: stability with a wide range of input (no bugs)
  - Resource Use: resources used conservatively (Big-O, memory, threads, ...)
  - Everything Else: elegance/robust-unit-tests/optimal-efficiency/...
* The Unix way feels right (http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html)

#### Other Credo
* Persistence (iteration) is disproportionately important to success.
* Rules are for people who don't know any better; Rules are important, but understanding sets you free.
* Luck is where Preparation meets Opportunity.
* To make the next best thing, the current best thing must be mundane.
* A spoonful of test dissolves a pound of design.
* Do not fear complexity; simplify.
