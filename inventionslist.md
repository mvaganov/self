# "List of Inventions" of Michael Vaganov

The purpose of this document is to strictly identify what software projects I (Michael Vaganov) am working on "during my own time" with "my own resources", which cannot be claimed by employers or any other party. This document is meant to be a summary, with additional documentation and exhibits available upon request.

The purpose of this document is NOT to discourage others, including my employers, from developing these projects themselves. I would like to encourage others to solve the same problems I'm working on, and would work on solutions like these with others, including my employer. This document is establishing prior art, so that my projects will not be claimed as belonging to others. I do not want to be prevented from working on my own projects in the future because of claimed intellectual property infringement.

Furthermore, as the sole developer of these projects and concepts, I explicitly release copyright and patent claims to these ideas into the public domain. I will maitain copyright of private source code and algorithms.

## Suffrag Ex Machina
(*Oct. 2018 to Present*)

A machine-learning engine built in C# to test an experimental ensemble learning technique (elects using ranked-choice voting). Includess optimized-matrix-math in C# and training optimizations which reduces training time for roughly equivalent accuracy when compared to a generic 'tutorial' artificial neural network.

The goal of the project is to get many different "brains" (differently trained neural networks, possibly with different specializations) to cooperatively decide choices. This process should include supporting choices with "opinions", which can be used later to better-train other neural networks on similar problems. It’s far from done, I’m still working on backward-feed-propagation to identify "key features", so networks can identify the root causes of their "why" when forming "opinions".

The long-term goal is to build a decision-making platform where humans and machines can cooperatively answer open-ended choice-questions, with a system that focuses on evidence; questions like: "What dinner should we eat?", "Who’s the best candidate?", "What do we do to prepare this farmland for climate change?" could be voted on, with value deduced from evidence in the source context.

## Ethos
(*Oct. 2016 to Present*)

A [prototype for a web-based assessment system](http://codegiraffe.com/qeval/qual.html) designed to provoke personality development. Still evolving, based on years of personal reflection, religious study, teaching experience, and leadership. Uses peer-review as the final evaluation mechanism. Open-sourced. Written in JavaScript.

Originally intended for school use, as an alternative to the A-F grades system, it might have some value in the management space. It could be used as a part of a performance review, or employee management using personality metrics.

This model might also have value as a starting point for developing ethics within artificial intelligence, which would dovetail into Suffrag Ex Machina.

## Impetus
(*Mar. 2006 to Present*)

I also call this "my dragon". An experimental suite of tools and prototypes to build a-game-about-Project-Management. This project is a manifestation of software from [my own personal vision of the future](https://github.com/mvaganov/self/blob/master/manifesto.md). It is primarily C# code, including a custom reflective scripting engine, and user interface components designed to manage projects. The UI components include a scriptable spreadsheet, and animating list structures that morph into a burn-down chart.

This project started as a mixture of my love of game-development and the project-management degree courses which I was taking in 2006. The simple idea started as a project-management automation tool. The idea has grown to include an agent-based-model as a real-time-strategy game (using behavior trees), infused with project-management tools, to be used as training software to help disenfranchised-gamer-youth-culture organize itself into something more productive.
