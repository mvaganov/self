# Mr. V's Manifesto

In preparation for [dramatically-powerful-computer-technology-in-the-near-future](http://www.codegiraffe.com/singularity.png), my short-term goal is to teach software development. My long-term goal is to help develop software to get mankind to organize itself better. More specifically, I want to teach young adults how to participate in large projects, to have transparent tools for functional governance, and to create benevolent AI that identifies tasks that humans can accomplish to achieve human goals. I have a succession of specific software projects in mind for this.

### Why "Teach Software Development" in the Short Term?

[The "Technological Singularity"](https://singularityhub.com/2015/01/26/ray-kurzweils-mind-boggling-predictions-for-the-next-25-years/) [ / achievement-of-super-intelligence-through-computer-technology](http://www.kurzweilai.net/blog) [is coming.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_Is_Near) There are many resources online that explain this, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) is an excellent starting-point for the un-initiated.

Regardless of your opinion on the technological-singularity, the fact that powerful-computing-technology is coming is very clear. Powerful-tools are dangerous if used unwisely. More eyes watching powerful-tools does-a-lot to keep those tools from being used unwisely. So, more computer-experts will do-a-lot to keep powerful computer technology from being used unwisely.

I also want to teach software development because I believe it creates better 21st-century people.

### A student of software development learns ...
* **attention to detail** - that instructions and information can be misunderstood, and being exact results in consistent performance. Working with syntax errors easily teaches this. C.S. students often notice their grammar and spelling habits changing from this exposure, even from just a few weeks of practice.
* **grit** - to accept error and imperfection as a natural part of learning, and to forgive-oneself quickly, so that progress can be made. Practicing anything improves grit, but practicing a task that constantly identifies that you are wrong, in cryptic-but-eventually-understantable ways, does it especially well.
* **to quickly test things out (rapid-prototyping)** - that writing and testing software is cheap, even when it fails. Having results from lots of quickly-done-and-*incorrect* solutions is a great guide toward a *correct*-solution. Lab-based Computer Science assignments teach this way, and encourages this behavior by having students create lots of new pieces of code from scratch.
* **anything can be understood** - that even incomprehensible systems can be understood one small piece at a time. This realization is one that creeps up on a person, and it comes once enough previously-incomprehensible-systems become comfortably unterstood.
* **to understanding unintuitive ideas** - that software works in ways that are not always easy to understand, but are still true, and eventually understandable. Comfort with unintuitive ideas acts as a defense against a variety of cognative biases, like stereotyping, and the-band-wagon effect.
* **stronger habits of problem solving** - that solving-a-problem is satisfying and encouraging, and anyone is capable of solving a problem. The world needs more problem solvers, and computer programming is all about how to solve problems with a computer.
* **new limits for personal mental ability** - solving software problems requires development of mental tools not required by many other fields of study. Computer programming Tools like breaking-problems-down-into-specific-steps, recursive thinking, object-oriented-composition, and others. These tools are widely applicable to many other fields of study, and easy to practice with programming.
* **confidence as a computer user** - that practice with computers alone makes someone better with computers. And there is a need for more confident computer users today, and in the future.
* **to think-about-thinking (metacognition)** - that creating-an-algorithm requires introspection: awareness of your own thought process, enough that you can name and list your own thoughts.
* **faith in science** - that hypothesis testing is an effective tool for developing human knowledge.
* **metacognitive awareness** - that ability to think is determined by mental state, and *managing mental state* (with food, sleep, addressing emotional issues, ...) is a foundation for successful problem solving.
* **fearlessness of computers** - that a computer is just a tool, with no emotions, no motives, no purpose beyond what it was designed to do, and the ability to multiply its programmer's intelligence and influence.
* **fail-fast** - the pholosophy of engineering: it is good to fail an entire-process the moment some small part is incorrect, so it *will* be fixed, and the process can be perfect sooner.
* **understanding is power** - that understanding-a-problem, all by itself, is almost enough to solve it.

I'm teaching technology to young people. It's existentially-satisfying, and I can't stop.

## Prophecy of the Future

As computer-technology improves, many (possibly most) people won't be able to find productive work. Computer-controlled tools will be able to do almost every task a human does, but better in many ways, almost certainly more cheaply. Humans will have computer-assisted jobs, taking advantage of hardware and software to multiply job effectiveness, using communication and embeded logic to duplicate effort, integrate logistics, reduce waste, educate on-the-fly, track quality/progess of workers, and more. The humans who are working have work output similar to hundreds or thousands of humans working without computers.

Computer tools will even be used for tasks that computers can't do well, like things that human-bodies are almost uniquely good at, things that involve human touch, direct human-to-human interaction, handling human emotions, witnessing the human condition, etc. Humans who know-use-computers-to-multiply-effort (what I like to call *wizards*) will be employable.

### What If I'm not a Wizard?

**"Impetus AR"** - a real-time re-education tool that will turn a population of disenfranchised meat-bags into a productive, organized work force. Imagine an Augmented Reality (AR) system that points a person toward productive actions that benefit the causes they are aligned with. The system identifies tasks, directs users to tools and resources, educates users on proper use of tools and resources, and logs the completion of tasks. Step-by-step-instructions, along with tool and resource information, will be fed to the AR system by "Impetus Jobs".

**"Impetus Jobs"** - Imagine a combination of LinkedIn and TaskRabbit, with a Strong-AI--prediction/analysis-tool balancing work-load for maximum probability of success. Impetus Jobs will have have information about a person as a worker, including their skills, preferred kinds of work, and life-goals. Workers will be matched with tasks nearby, with worker advancement in-mind. Tutorial tasks will be created by the system to improve skills, and work toward accomplishment of ideals and life-goals of the workers. Very large tasks, composed of many subtasks, will be populated by a project-management-software suite, "Impetus Project".

**"Impetus Project"** - Project-management software that handles arbitrary tasks of arbitrary complexity, resource usage, and personnel. It's a database of work to do, and how to do it. It works with tasks in many different dimensions, including step-by-step instructions as work-breakdown-structures, GANTT charts, burndown charts (for tracking), and resource & personnel spread-sheets. Impetus Project also does predictive-analysis of projects using algorithms that improve estimation with data from past performance (no "strong-AI", that is what Impetus Jobs is for). The data model and user interface for Impetus Project is based on the game "Galactus".

**"Galactus"** - A real-time strategy game about seeking out partner-agents, with diverse skill sets, to accomplish complex goals. Goal-objects are worked by an agent skills. An agent working a skill improves the agent's skill, and allows greater goals to be completed. Some goals have a dependency-graph that forces sub-goals to be accomplished first (think GANTT chart), in sometimes complex sequences. Agents recruit partner-agents with complementary skills to accomplish complex goals. This is done in an eco-system of other agent groups, who are all seeking to accomplish goals as well.

***"My Dragon"*** - The name you'll hear me use to refer to this plan.

Galactus comes first. It has to be a game first (and project-management-software second), otherwise it will not be adopted as easily by disenfranchised-gamer millenials, who are a risk to society if they cannot find a way to learn to integrate into works larger than themselves. Sadly, *game development* is not a lucrative industry. But...

Once there is a game that is usable as enterprise software, selling a version of that game as enterprise software should be possible. The sales ptch could be "Many of your young employees already know this user interface well. The interface is a game that teaches mastery of itself." Learning-curve and user-interface tend to be big complaints about *enterprise software*, which by the way, *is* a lucrative industry.

Impetus Jobs is a natural evolution of Impetus Project: integrate social-media and job-boards, apply machine learning.

Impetus AR will need cheap AR hardware, mature machine-vision software technology, and significant amounts of dynamic tutorial content for which there are currently (as of Oct 2017) no models.

## Specific Short-term Goals
(This is essentially a public TODO list)

### Teaching
* CS2 - *A Computer Science Montage*
  * grading, analysis, adding content to fill gaps, streamlining
* Teaching Virtual Reality development
  * documenting Unity tutorials
  * practice problems for C#, similar to the *montage* from CS2
  * Nonstandard Assets - a complimentary API to Unity providing common useful tools.

### My Dragon (Galactus Phase)
* 3D math code (command zones, AI, 3D voronoi, navmesh pathfinding)
  * in development in Unity3D. finding a good 3D-voronoi library would help a lot.
* spreadsheet UI
  * in development in Unity3D, with functional scripting engine. I just need to get this done. I'll probably open-source it when I do.
* Instant Runoff Voting tools (multiplayer decision making, AI)
  * need to convert .js code to C#, develop visuals, probably share that as a stand-alone data visualization app. It's too much of my own code to give to someone else.
* dynamic stat system
  * using common scripting system also used by spreadsheet UI, may not scale well to thousands of objects. If I can generate C# objects with a runtime compiler, I'll have to create and use properties to replicate callback behavior around property updates.
* General AI (state-machines, steering behaviors)
  * should find a good API someone else wrote and add 3D math code to it. would be nice to find someone who is a pro at this.
* movement/control modes (space fly, FPS/3rd-Person, ground-fly)
  * need to stabalize code, add support for animations for fully-customizable models. would be nice to find a pro at this too.
* artifact building
  * agent can build roads, barriers, caches, monuments. need to fully spec this out in a design doc.
* VR controls
  * more experimentation required, need to integrate into movement/control UI. need to bone-up on VR UI standards, or find an expert.
* scripting system
  * need to make imperative code more java-script like.
* Project & Task system
  * use the scripted JSON-like datastructures as the base. Already have examples of this working.
* Personnel & Resource system
  * requires spreadsheet UI, scripts, and stat/trait system for personnel to inform AI simulation. The RankedVote visual will help show resource/personnel usage.
* Project Management Visualizations (WBS, GANTT, burndown)
  * refresh and import old code.
* Customization UI
  * need to find and implement color picker, sprite loader/picker, simple model generator and basic texture mapper.
