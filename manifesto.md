<h1>Mr. V's Manifesto, Oct 2017</h1>

In preparation for dramatically-powerful-computer-technology-in-the-near-future, my short-term goal is to teach software development. My long-term goal is to write software to help mankind organize itself better. More specifically, I want to develop systems to address dysfunctional governance, to productively expose purpose to people, and to create AI that seeks out logistical efficiency in human tasks while accounting for human goals. I have a succession of specific software products in mind for this.

<h2>Why "Teach Software Development" in the Short Term?</h2>

<a href="http://www.codegiraffe.com/singularity.png">The "Technological Singularity" / achievement-of-super-intelligence-through-computer-technology is coming.</a> There are many resources online that explain this, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">Wikipedia</a> is an excellent starting-point for the un-initiated.

Regardless of your opinion on the technological-singularity, the fact that powerful-computing-technology is coming is very clear. Powerful-tools are dangerous if used unwisely. More eyes watching powerful-tools does-a-lot to keep those tools from being used unwisely. So, more computer-experts will do-a-lot to keep powerful computer technology from being used unwisely.

Practicing software development encourages important habits of mind, which are especially beneficial for young people. A student of computer software learns ...
* confidence as a better computer user - familiarity and practice with computers alone make someone better with computers in the future.
* attention to detail - that instructions and information can be misunderstood, and exact detail results in consistent performance.
* humility and grit - to accept error and imperfection as a natural part of learning, and to forgive-oneself so that progress can be made.
* faith in science - that forming a hypothesis and testing it to validate understanding is a profoundly effective tool for developing human knowledge.
* resilience to complexity - that even incomprehensible systems can be understood one small piece at a time.
* patience with unintuitive truth - software works in ways that are not always easy to understand, but are still true, and eventually understandable.
* intrinsic reward from success - that solving-a-problem is satisfying and encouraging, in a way that is proportional to difficulty.
* new limits of personal mental ability - solving software problems requires that a person learn new mental tools.
* the value of deep understanding - that a-strong-understanding-of-the-problem alone is almost enough to solve it.
* metacognition - to create an algorithm requires introspection: awareness of your own thought process, enough that you can name and list thoughts.
* metacognitive awareness - that mental ability is determined by mental state, and managing mental state (with food, sleep, addressing emotional issues, ...) is a foundation for success in problem solving.
* fearlessness of computers - a computer is just a tool, with no emotions, no motives, and no purpose beyond what it was designed to do.

I'm teaching kids technology. It's existentially-satisfying, and I can't stop.

<h2>The Future</h2>

As computer-technology improves, many (possibly most) people won't be able to find productive work. Computer-controlled tools will be able to do almost every task a human does, but most-likely better, and almost certainly far more cheaply. Humans will have computer assisted jobs, taking advantage of hardware-and-software to multiply effectiveness, using communication and embeded logic to integrate logistics, reduce waste, educate on-the-fly, track quality/progess of workers, and more.

Computer tools will even be used for tasks that computers can't do well, like things that human-bodies are almost uniquely good at, things that involve human touch, direct human-to-human interaction, handling human emotions, witnessing the human condition, etc. Humans who know how to use computers to multiply their own effort doing these tasks will be employable.

<h2>So what about everyone who is not a computer wizard?</h2>

"Impetus AR" - a real-time re-education tool that will turn a population of disenfranchised meat-bags into a productive, organized work force. Imagine an Augmented Reality (AR) system that points a person toward productive actions that benefit the causes they are aligned with. The system identifies tasks, directs users to tools and resources, educates users on proper use of tools and resources, and logs the completion of their tasks. Step-by-step-instruction, along with tool and resource information will be fed to the AR system by "Impetus Jobs".

"Impetus Jobs" - Imagine a combination of LinkedIn and TaskRabbit, with a Strong-AI data prediction/analysis tool balancing work-load for maximum probability of success. Impetus Jobs will have have information about a person as a worker, including their skills, preferred kinds of work, and life-goals. Workers will be matched with tasks nearby, with worker advancement in-mind. Tutorial tasks will be created by the system to improve skills, and work toward accomplishment of ideals and life-goals of the workers. Very large tasks, composed of many subtasks, will be populated by a project-management-software suite, "Impetus Project".

"Impetus Project" - Excellent project-management software that handles tasks of arbitrary complexity, resource usage, and personnel. It works with tasks in many different dimensions, including work-breakdown-structure, GANTT chart, burndown chart, resource & personnel spread-sheets, and more. Impetus Project also does predictive-analysis of projects using algorithms that improve estimation with data from past performance. The data model and user interface for Impetus Project is based on the game "Galactus".

"Galactus" - A real-time strategy game about seeking out partner-agents, with diverse skill sets, to accomplish complex goals. Goal-objects are worked by an agent skills. Working skill improves skill, and allows greater goals to be completed. Some goals have a dependency-graph that forces sub-goals to be accomplished first, in sometimes complex sequences. Agents recruit partner-agents with complementary skills to accomplish complex goals.

"My Dragon": The plan I'm following in pursuit of the software outlined above

Galactus comes first. It has to be a game (and project-management-software second), otherwise it will not be adopted as easily by disenfranchised millenials, who are otherwise a social risk. Sadly, game development is not an economically wise business plan. But...

Once there is a game that is usable as enterprise software, selling a version of that game as Enterprise software should not be impossible. The sales proposition could be as simple as "Many of your young employees already know this user interface well. The interface is a game that teaches mastery of itself." Learning-curve and user-interface tend to be the biggest complaints about Enterprise software, which by the way, is a lucrative industry.

Impetus Jobs is a natural evolution of Impetus Project: integrate social-media and job-boards, apply machine learning.

Impetus AR will need cheap AR hardware, mature machine-vision software technology, and significant amounts of dynamic tutorial content for which there are currently (as of Oct 2017) no models.

Current foci for Galactus (essentially a public TODO list):
* (dev) 3D math code (command zones, AI, 3D voronoi, navmesh pathfinding)
* (dev) spreadsheet UI
* (dev) Instant Runoff Voting tools (multiplayer decision making, AI)
* (usable) dynamic stat system
* (dev) General AI (state-machines, steering behaviors)
* (usable) movement/control modes (space fly, FPS/3rd-Person, ground-fly)
* (dev) VR controls
* (usable) scripting system
* (plan) Project & Task system
* (plan) Personnel & Resource system
* (dev) Project Management Visualizations (WBS, GANTT, burndown)
* (plan) customizable models
