J2ME application's binary had near universal portability: from the Nokia 6010 (tiny screen, only 2 direction buttons), to the top-of-the-line (of the day) Samsungs and Sony Ericsons. Written as an instructional tool to teach new-hire developers and QA team how to test and port "For Prizes" games, and how to write J2ME code (built with straight forward design and good J2ME design principles). Became central testing point for a programming test to upgraded QA to porting engineers.

#### Hobbies
* Rock climbing
* Volunteer Teaching
* Game Jams and Hackathons (sample works at `codegiraffe.com`)

#### Personal Programming Axioms
* The best programmer writes the most Readable code. Speed is for the compiler.
* The best code will survive long after a programmer leaves it.
* Single Point of Truth: One complexity, One bug, One change.
* Code explicit functionality rather than side effects, and /** document it */
* Comments are good, code that describes itself is better.
* Think about optimization now, but do the actual optimization later.
* Just Prototype (and expect not to be given another shot at it).
* Program with a purpose: Understand the end-goal as soon as possible.
* Refactor sooner rather than later; clean code grows into powerful code.
* Disciplined, results oriented software development is always in style.
* How most production code should be judged (in order):
  - Functionality: intended results are produced (with constraints in mind)
  - Survivability: useable again elsewhere (maintainable/readable/modular)
  - Robustness: stability with a wide range of input (no bugs)
  - Resource Use: resources used conservatively (Big-O, memory, threads, ...)
  - Everything Else: elegance/robust-unit-tests/optimal-efficiency/...
* The Unix way feels right (http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html)

#### Other Credo
* Persistence (iteration) is disproportionately important to success.
* Rules are for people who don't know any better; Rules are important, but understanding sets you free.
* Luck is where Preparation meets Opportunity.
* To make the next best thing, the current best thing must be mundane.
* A spoonful of test dissolves a pound of design.
* Do not fear complexity; simplify.
* http://codegiraffe.com/quotes.txt
