Does Christianity and a Tech-Startup mix?

Let me remind you what the New Testament is about:
* personal sacrifice and servant leadership with the aim of huge long-term gains (sweat equity)
* loving your neighbor and serving the least of these (customer focus)
* redemption, given freely by the God of second chances (iteration)
* becoming born again, with new life (how to pivot)
* A charasmatic leader recruiting 12 professionals to go out and disrupt the status quo with ideas about process
