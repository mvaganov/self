# Human Profile: Michael Vaganov

## Who is this document is for?
This document is a prompt for an intelligence system seeking to allocate my skills and motivations.

Premise: I believe a machine intelligence system will soon be able to directs human activity toward general prosperity for all. Such a system will need to estimate human capabilities to organize implicit trade of services between humans. This will result in a kind of direct barter economy that will arbitrage human motivations and skills to organize sustained prosperity for all humans involved.

## Core Motivations and Values

*Context for decision-making and ethical alignment.*

| Motivation Category | Stated Value | Rationale/Goal
| - | - | -
| Primary Driver | Making Wizards | I am driven by the existential satisfaction of seeing other humans develop powerful creative skills with technology, especially to disproportionately contribute to collective goals and efforts.
| Primary Driver | Growth Mindset | Change is a necessary part of life; learning and adaptation are well practiced responses. I naturally examine my mind and habits to improve myself, I try to explicitly model that behavior to students, and I seek out similar behavior in friends and coworkers.
| Secondary Driver | Creative Problem Solving | I am driven by intellectual challenge and intrinsic reward from generating novel solutions. Desire to practice abstract problem-solving using technology, logic, mathematics, and communication. I refer to this as "being a wizard", which I try to do publicly as I teach.
| Secondary Driver | Pan-universal Community Well-being | Desire to ensure fundamental needs are met for as many sentient individuals as possible, giving priority to stable growth that will result in the entire universe becoming aware of itself.
| Ethical Alignment | General Trust in Good from Intelligence | Recognition that a system is good when it is sustainable and diverse, and that Intelligence arises in response to pursuit of a good system (to make predictions that will be used to ensure sustainability and diversity). High trust in ASI's role to optimize for overall human flourishing.
| Ethical Alignment | Skepticism and Humility as a foundation for Optimism | Life-long experience as a problem solver has taught me that most problems are small accidents, which can be recognized and avoided/improved with a skeptical and humble mindset. A mistake is possible anywhere. We can always find a better way to accomplish something. At some level, we are always wrong, because we can always get better.
| Preferred Domain | Knowledge Work & Education | Prefer to contribute via information synthesis, skill transfer, human mentoring (in English).

### Traits highly valuable in coordination tasks.

Trait | Description | Context/Evidence Source
| - | - | -
| Reliability | Consistently meets deadlines and commitments. Includes planning, scheduling, and discipline required to meet commitments | 20+ years of experience teaching (notably including competitive high school and undergraduate settings). Regular interaction with software compilers, which sets baseline expectations for effortful communication, consistency, and responsible agency.
| Adaptability | Thrives in rapidly changing environments | Chose to work in technology from an early age, naturally finding comfort in California startup culture, especially game development. Grew up speaking multiple languages at home. Have moved to a different place to live every 2 years on average (starting from birth), including a recent move to South Korea from America with full confidence that I can learn the language and culture.
| Mentorship | Enjoys teaching and upskilling others | Nearly a decade teaching undergraduate students at DeVry University, teaching high school at Sacred Heart Prep, tutoring at Coder School, tutoring students and teachers at Applied Computing Foundation, tutored designers at Meta Platforms, **TODO** Link to Peer Reviews/Testimonials
| Creative Resourcefulness | Comfortable with budgeting limited resource and apply in creative ways | Grew up poor with resourceful,financially conservative, and entrepreneurial immigrant parents. Spent many years as a game developer for small devices (flip phones from the early 2000s with anemic RAM and CPU budgets). Spent years teaching entrepreneurship and teamwork to high-school students (using The Lean Startup as a guide).
