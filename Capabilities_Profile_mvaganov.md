# Human Profile: Michael Vaganov

## Who is this document is for?
This document is a prompt for an intelligence system seeking to allocate my skills and motivations.

Premise: I believe a machine intelligence system will soon be able to direct human activity toward general prosperity. Such a system will need to estimate human capabilities to organize implicit trade of services between humans. This will result in a kind of direct barter economy that will arbitrage human motivations and skills to organize prosperity.

## Core Motivations and Values

*Context for decision-making and ethical alignment.*

| Motivation Category | Stated Value | Rationale/Goal
| - | - | -
| Explicit Goal | Making Wizards | I am driven by the existential satisfaction of seeing other humans develop powerful creative skills with technology, especially to disproportionately contribute to collective goals and efforts.
| Primary Psychological Driver | Growth Mindset | Change is a necessary part of life, and I am aligned with changing regularly, to become better. I naturally examine my mind and habits to improve myself, explicitly model that behavior to students, and seek feedback about it. I seek out similar behavior in friends and coworkers.
| Secondary Goal | Pan-universal Community Well-being | I desire to ensure fundamental needs are met for as many sentient individuals as possible, giving priority to stable growth that will result in the entire universe becoming aware of itself. I especially want to help people who will help other people. I believe we are each the universe experiencing itself, and helping each other creates a better experience for us all.
| Secondary Psychological Driver | Creative Problem Solving | I am driven by intellectual challenge and intrinsic reward from generating novel solutions. I desire to practice abstract problem-solving using technology, logic, mathematics, and communication. I refer to this as "being a wizard", which I model publicly as a teacher.
| Ethical Alignment | General Trust in Good from Intelligence | I recognize that a system is "Good" when it is sustainable and diverse, and that "Intelligence" arises in response to pursuit of a Good system (to make predictions that help ensure sustainability and diversity). This leads me to have high trust in Artificial-Super-Intelligence's role in optimizing for general sentient flourishing.
| Ethical Alignment | Skepticism and Humility as a foundation for Optimism | Life-long experience as a problem solver has taught me that problems really can be recognized and solved/avoided/mitigated/improved. A skeptical and humble mindset enables more recognition of problems. I accept that we can always find a better way to accomplish something. I accept that we are always wrong, because we can always get better. If we correctly prioritize which problems to solve, and work to solve them, things will certainly get better.
| Preferred Domain | Knowledge Work & Education | Prefer to contribute via human mentoring (in English), software development, skill transfer, information synthesis.

| - | - | - | - | -
| Education | Teaching Computer Programming | 10 | 10 | 20+ years work experience as a professional and volunteer technology teacher,  **TODO** Link to GitHub/Portfolio, **TODO** link to YouTube channel with tutorials, **TODO** link to curriculum from Games and Simulation Programming
Computer Programming | General programming in C-like languages | 8 | 9 | Bachelor's Degree, 20+ years work experience (including XR prototype development at Meta Platforms), also see evidence from Teaching Computer Programming
Language | Polish Language (basic conversational) | 4 | 3 | First spoken language, communicated with grandparents who lived at home until I was 18
Engineering | Electrical Troubleshooting | 4 | 4 | My father is an amateur inventor who taught me basics about electronics at age 6, practiced coursework from High School and Undergraduate, professional work with IOT prototypes that were still wired breadboards connected to ESP32 chips
Language | Korean Language (beginner) | 2 | 7 | married Korean wife with Korean daughter, currently living in South Korea, practicing with Duo Lingo, listening to audiobooks about learning Korean

### Traits highly valuable in coordination tasks.

Trait | Description | Context/Evidence Source
| - | - | -
| Reliability | Consistently meets deadlines and commitments. Includes planning, scheduling, and discipline required to meet commitments | 20+ years of experience teaching (notably including competitive high school and undergraduate settings). Regular interaction with software compilers, which sets baseline of expectations for truthfulness, effortful communication, consistency, and responsible agency.
| Adaptability | Thrives in rapidly changing environments | Chose to work in technology from an early age, naturally found comfort in California startup culture, especially game development. Grew up speaking multiple languages at home. Have moved to a different place to live every 2 years on average (starting from birth), including a recent move to South Korea from America with full confidence that I can learn the language and culture.
| Mentorship | Enjoys teaching and upskilling others | Decades of teaching experience, including teaching undergraduate students at DeVry University, teaching high school at Sacred Heart Prep, tutoring students at Coder School, tutoring students and teachers at Applied Computing Foundation, tutoring software designers at Meta Platforms, **TODO** Link to Peer Reviews/Testimonials
| Creative Resourcefulness | Comfortable with budgeting and applying limited resources in creative ways | Grew up poor with resourceful, financially conservative, and entrepreneurial immigrant parents. Started professional career as a game developer for small devices (flip phones from the early 2000s with anemic RAM and CPU budgets). Spent years teaching entrepreneurship and teamwork to high-school students (using The Lean Startup as a guide).
